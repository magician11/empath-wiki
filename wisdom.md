Only share your feelings with someone you love.

### On fighting
Instead of fighting with someone, "plant the seed" of change... and to plant it elegantly, beautifully, gracefully, prudently.

> "taking a stand for what's right" firmly and clearly but while listening and responding to the other's perspectives so as to actually enter into conversation about the problem is somewhat similar to "battle stance" but hopefully w/o all the internal and external conflict and tendency for things to turn defensive.

i've begun to learn to step away sometimes, be angry, frustrated, cry, whatever i need to do- then think it through a little and try to come back more calmly. when the situation allows for it, 

Timing on where to share truth is important.

### Boundaries

We have it hard to set up boundaries to  keep ourselves from being drained out of energy. We have the soul and heart of gold in a way just kind, maybe too kind for the new high paced evolving world. **How can we keep ourselves safe from being depleted?**

"Time will not heal everything, but acceptance might just be a better way to find the healing". We were born to be free as we embrace the freedom, the nature, the unknow and just everything mostly. We cannot be caged in walls we build on our own. Should we put fences around us to keep our energy? **No**. How about accepting the fact that we will always want to help someone even when we are at our knees? Will that change things?

Maybe in a way it will, if we know we will do something in any given situation that will make us think about the risks it pulls along. Let's say you are in a forest walking around to your destination and you find someone in a hole, a deep one. You'll want to help him out right? That's done you help him out of the hole what's next? Will you follow him or your own path? That's where the boundary come in i believe. Helping people is one thing but getting wrapped around others energy is just another. 

Lets take physics as some examples. Harmonic motion if i remember correctly you put up two masses in a pendulum and swing one of them while the other one stays at rest. Suddenly the one moving comes at rest while the other starts moving. Amazing! but that happens with our energies too so how can we prevent that?

Good question. I haven't found a proper way yet that i can say do this this and this. It's an evolving process but i can say that:

1) know your energy, feel it, embrace it but don't try to suppress it

   You cannot go against your own nature and hurt your very soul. Do things the old way but find the loopholes and fix them. :)
   
2) Protect yourself in a water bubble

   Why water? It is pure and you can visualize water being filtered easier. Lets say your energy is the water and you have a fountain up              your head that keeps pouring the water. The enegies of other people being oil, once close to you they will just float to the surface and once there just fall off the bubble leaving you on your own happy energy.

This happens to work for me :) hope it does for you to.
