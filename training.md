## Lessons

### Lesson 1

Know all that is knowable, then proceed. Remain where you are until you know.

We are all in a classroom which is our planet Earth.
Our books are nature, the elements, the visual panorama of life, and living together.

Tools:
1. Make sure all your communication is truthful and intentional.
2. Listen to understand.
3. Practice till you master your lesson.
4. Self intention.

### Lesson 2

Our soul is part of a Universal whole. We are actually all connected and not separate as we are encouraged to feel.

If someone feels toxic to you, send them healing energy, and move on. It's not up to us if they awaken or not.

What's really important is how people feel, not what they say or do.

### Lesson 3

It is imperative for you to open your mind totally. Your awareness is active and has the ability to sense everything all the time. It is actually doing this right now.

Opening up to that moment is all. When it is reached there is no doubt your there. 

Your sense of perception is key.

Meditation with intent. Focus.
See what is really there. 
Expirement with purpose to KNOW THE TRUTH

Intent is the key.

Its work is desirable.

The reward or lesson learned. Valuable

Why. Because you OWN IT.

it becomes YOU.
