## The Art of Loving
By Erich Fromm.
I love Erich Fromm's books. He was social psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. His books about philosophical and sociological aspects of humanity (freedom, fear, to be and to have, democracy) are fantastic. This book is particularly special because he is not referring to love as romantic relationship (although this is also part of loving and it is including in the book) but what love is for us as human beings and how it represents to us: the love to a higher being, parenthood, brotherhood, community and why loving is an art and why it needs practice and study to be mastered.

## Black Hole Focus: How Intelligent People Can Create a Powerful Purpose for Their Lives
By Isaiah Hankel. This book is a pearl. It gave me the structure and planning I required in my life. It gave me the tools to understand what I have to offer, what I want to learn and how and where to direct myself to, to draw my path. Thanks to this book I do my principles/intention/action board by the end of each year.

##  Clean (Program)
By Dr. Alejandro Junger. This was the book that pushed my health and fitness for better, and introduced me to health and fitness literature (I love reading about health and fitness). I read it and did my first detox diet 5 years ago. This detox program became my yearly ritual.

## Man's Search for Meaning
By Viktor E. Frankl

Viktor E. Frankl is a brilliant psychiatrist that survived the Holocaust. He recalls his experiences and profound thoughts on suffering. He finds that people who find purpose and meaning in their suffering can withstand anything. This book inspired me in so many ways, it’s hard to even put it all into words. For anyone wanting to find purpose in their lives, this is the book to read. It’s just the thing needed to ask yourself the big questions. The prisoners Frankl saw that had nothing to live for, were the first to die. Those that saw something bigger than themselves, kept fighting. It’s not so different in our own lives today, so many slowly dying in front of the tv, in a job they hate, waiting for something to change. Be the change in your life, the power is yours. This book is exactly what you need to inspire profound change.
