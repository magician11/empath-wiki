## As empath, what and how you perceive what's around you? Do you feel only from people - and what, or also from animals, plants, earth, weather, entities, consciousness, cosmos, etc? And how do you perceive such information? as human emotions? as images? sounds? colours? vibrations? frequencies?

### People:
- Having a good sense of who they are after the first meeting. For instance: sensing out whether a person is pretending or not, whether they are primarily ego driven or whether they are struggling with something deeper. 
- Getting a good sense of what people’s inner world looks like after few meetings.
- Being sensitive to hurt energy and sensing when somebody is carrying something heavy. Feeling it in the gut. Feeling deeply where a person's pain lies by simply connecting with them.
- Walking into a room and have a good feeling as to whether a heavy or light topic was just discussed.
- Feeling the "spots of no-light/fears" in a person when knowing them to the point as feeling those spots as our own. 
- Sometimes feeling people screaming inside, feeling and knowing that they need some kind of help.
- Analogy: people are like water, always flowing and changing. Not sticking with a first impression. The more exposure to a person, the more understandable their flow is.
- Having "touching issues”. Getting linked to when shaking hands, kissing, hugging. Just one touch allows to feel many years after what they feel, what they need, what they want.
- Feeling people drastically change when facing crisis

### Weather:
- Nature perceived as comforting.
- Connecting with nature especially in the evenings, when the chance to really 'hear' what the earth is saying and connecting with own feelings. Feeling the earth most comes alive during the evening moonlight.
- Finding daylight disruptive due to traffic and noise and buzz of daily living. I'm also deeply sensitive to weather and the 'consciousness' of a setting. 
- Finding Hot weather draining
- Sensing rain beautifully- similarly to being showered in love.

### Vibrations/Frequencies:
- Feeling emotions as "low frequencies" peaks in own body and vibrating/resonating/attuning to those vibrations. For instance, when a person speaks and something comes out of that "shadow spot", being able to sense the low frequency in that. 
- Humans feel like long frequencies with all sort of peaks and periods


### Music
- Feeling music as passion and therapy.
- Not relating to people to songs or music but mostly relating them to timeframes.
- Analogy: each person is like a melody, and their fears create gaps, or out-of-tune notes. Being very good at figuring out the pure melody of each person, meaning how the person would look at her/his best. Being able to "hear" that melody, even if the person is full of these gaps and out-of-tune notes. 
- Being very musical and associating people's frequencies/emotions/feelings with specific songs and music pieces. 

### Images:
- Mind interpreting/translating people’s emotions as images. 

### plants:
- Sensing plants’ communication different from humans. Feeling plants as spot on peak of frequency... like a sudden clear beep that pops up an image.

### Auras/Energies:
- Perceiving things by their energies, sort of a frequency/vibration/image mix. 
- With eyes open, seeing the auras of something. Sensing a faint blur around things in a mixture of frequency/vibration/image.  
- Aura colours change with moods.
- When eyes are closed and when being close enough, being able to reach out to something and ‘feeling’ that something is there. The feeling is less like an image and more like a liquid that's made of frequencies and something else unable to identify.
- Being able to sense energies from all living things, including “non-living” things. 
- Seeing coloured, auras, and associating people with colours, animals, symbols, just a way or tools to build some kind of profile. Using this as some kind of code that is used to understand and decode people, their behaviour and motivations.

### Animals:
