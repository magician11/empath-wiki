# Protection Strategies For Empaths
A quick summary of 5 Protection Strategies For Empaths

##  5 Protection Strategies for Empaths" by Judith Orloff
1. Shielding Visualization:
The minute you’re uncomfortable with a person, place, or situation, put up your shield. Begin by taking a few, deep, long breaths. Then visualize a beautiful shield of white or pink light completely surrounding your body and extending a few inches beyond it. This shield protects you from anything negative, stressful, toxic, or intrusive. Within the protection of this shield, feel yourself centered, happy, and energized. This shield blocks out negativity, but at the same time, you can still feel what’s positive and loving.

2. Define and Express Your Relationship Needs
Knowing your needs and being able to assert them is a strong form of self-protection for empaths. Then you can be in your full power in a relationship. If something doesn’t feel right, raise the issue with your partner rather than suffering silently. Finding your voice is equivalent to finding your power–otherwise you may become exhausted, anxious, or feel like a doormat in relationships where your basic needs are unmet. Your partner isn’t a mind reader. Speak up to safeguard your well-being.

3. Set Energetic Boundaries at Work & Home
Empaths often suffer in their environment when they absorb the stress in their surroundings. The workplace especially can be noisy and over-stimulating. To protect your energy level in an emotionally demanding or crowded environment surround the outer edge of your space with plants or family or pet photos to create a small psychological barrier. Sacred objects such as a statue of Quan Yin (the goddess of compassion), the Buddha, sacred beads, crystals, or protective stones can set an energetic boundary. Noise cancelling ear buds or headphones are also useful to muffle conversations and sound.

4. Prevent Empathy Overload
When you’re absorbing the stress or symptoms of others and you need to release the negative energy inhale lavender essential oil or put a few drops midway between your eyebrows (on your third eye) to calm yourself. When you able spend time in nature. Balance your alone time with people time. For me, time management is key to my sanity. I try not to schedule patients back-to-back. In my personal life, I don’t plan too many things in one day. I’ve also learned to cancel plans when I get overloaded. This is a skill all empaths must learn so you don’t feel obliged to go out if you’re tired and need rest.
Set clear limits with energy vampires and toxic people. Remember, “No” is a complete sentence. You don’t have to keep explaining yourself. Finally practice self-compassion. Be sweet to yourself whenever possible—avoid beating yourself up. After a hard day tell yourself, “I did the best I could. It’s okay.”

5. The Jaguar Protection Meditation
When you need extra protection I recommend this meditation to call on the power of the jaguar to protect you. The jaguar is a fierce and patient guard who can keep toxic energy and people away. In a calm meditative state, from your deepest heart, call on the spirit of the jaguar to protect you. Feel her presence enter. Then, visualize this gorgeous, powerful creature patrolling your energy field, encircling it, protecting you, keeping out intruders or any negative forces that want to get through. Picture what the jaguar looks like: his or her beautiful, fierce, loving eyes; sleek body; the graceful, purposeful way the jaguar moves. Feel secure in the circle of this jaguar’s protection. Give inner thanks to the jaguar. Know that you can call on her whenever there is a need. Feel the power of that.

## From "How to Protect Your Energy" by Judith Orloff
Our common beliefs that drain your intuitive healing power:

I’m not strong enough to protect myself.
As children, many of us aren’t taught to believe in the full power we contain. Our starting point is to recognize we possess a very real internal source which enables us to deeply see and know. Yet when something goes wrong, frequently our first impulse is to look outside ourselves for someone to “fix” us. We get sick; we rush to the doctor. We become depressed; we call a therapist. We’re in pain; we take a pill. It’s fine to seek expertise–but we have it backwards. Look inside first. Then act on what your wisdom tells you. Remember: Your inner self is more than your inner child. Far grander–capable of ministering to all your needs–is the radiance of your spirit. Feeling this, knowing this, is the best protection of all. You must become your own champion before anyone else can. When you believe in yourself, no one else can diminish you.

Other people’s negative thoughts can harm me.
On an intuitive healing level, ill intentions or feelings can affect us, creating anxiety or physical dis-ease. We must train ourselves to deflect them. What is negative energy? Any force antithetical to your well-being. What do you do?

Strategies to develop intuitive healing:

Don’t lead a lifestyle based on assuming others are out to get you. This perpetuates fear.
If someone is sending you negative thoughts, avoid dwelling on them. The more attention you pay to negativity, the more influence you give it.
Focusing on the strength of your inner self is the best defense against negativity, no matter how dramatic its manifestation. If you are solidly connected to yourself, nothing can get you.
I’m too sensitive for my own good.
The arch-enemy of intuition is lack of sensitivity. Know this: There is no such thing as being overly sensitive. To grasp the concept, you may have to reconfigure old ideas that have been drummed into your head. For both sexes, to break down childhood armoring requires extraordinary commitment, trust, and resolve. It’s about slowly learning, in your own time frame, to remain wide open to an intuitive realm–being one with the wind, the moon, other people’s joys, sorrows, the continuum of life and death. From this comes an intimate ecstatic bond with all of existence, exactly what you don’t want to protect yourself from. Sensitivity only turns against you when you feel overwhelmed. It is possible to remain vulnerable and feel safe. The answer is never to shut your sensitivity off but to develop it as a creative resource.

It’s my job to take on the pain of others.
We’re trained that as big-hearted people it’s laudable to try to relieve the pain of others. A homeless person holding a cardboard sign, “I’m hungry. Will work for food” at a busy intersection; a hurt child; a distraught friend. It’s natural to want to reach out to them, ease their angst. But many of us don’t stop there. Inadvertently, we take it on. Suddenly we’re the one feeling desolate, off kilter, bereft, when we felt fine before. This loss of center is what I want to address. It does not serve us. I am adamant: the most compassionate, effective route to healing people is to be a supportive presence, not attempt to live their pain for them. Moreover, sometimes suffering has its own cycle that has to be respected, hard as that may be to witness.

We must lie to rest the old metaphysical prototype of the empathic healer. Typically grossly obese women (extra weight, they mistakenly argued, was the only way to stay grounded), who cured patients by absorbing symptoms with the technique of laying on of hands. The result? Patients would leave feeling better; the healers would be a sickly wreck. These women were convinced such a sacrifice was necessary to lessen the suffering of others.
Learn the value of being a catalyst for people’s growth without compromising well-being. You can’t do the work for the others. That is not your job. Keep this in mind: it is none of our business to deprive anyone else of their life experiences. I understand the impulse to want to make things better. Compassion and the desire to console are human. But there’s a fine line between supporting someone and trying to do it for them. No matter how well-meaning or heartfelt your intention, doing too much is not an act of love but of sabotage. You can be caring and honest with someone, yet still let them be. Don’t equate honoring their growth process with abandoning them. A practical philosophy of intuitive healing must include preserving your energy as well as serving others.

Striking a balance is essential.

# 6 Survival Tips For Empaths
A quick summary of 6 Survival Tips For Empaths

1. Move away. When possible, distance yourself by at least twenty feet from the suspected source. See if you feel relief. Don’t err on the side of not wanting to offend anyone. At the gathering try not to sit next to the identified energy vampire. Physical closeness increases empathy.

2. Breathe. If you suspect you are picking up someone else’s energies, concentrate on your breath for a few minutes. This is centering and connects you to your power. In contrast, holding your breath keeps negativity lodged in your body. To purify fear and pain, exhale stress and inhale calm. Picture unwholesome emotions as a gray fog lifting from your body, and wellness as a clear light entering it. This can produce quick results.

3. Practice Guerilla Meditation. Be sure to meditate before the gathering, centering yourself, connecting to spirit, feeling your heart. Get strong. If you counter emotional or physical distress while at an event, act fast and meditate for a few minutes. You can do this by taking refuge in the bathroom or an empty room. If it’s public, close the stall. Meditate there. Calm yourself. Focus on positivity and love. This has saved me many times at social functions where I feel depleted by others.

4. Set healthy limits and boundaries. Control how much time you spend listening to stressful people, and learn to say “no.” Set clear limits and boundaries with people, nicely cutting them off at the pass if they get critical or mean. Remember, “no” is a complete sentence.

5. Visualize protection around you. Research has shown that visualization is a healing mind/body technique. A practical form of protection many people use, including health care practitioners with difficult patients, involves visualizing an envelope of white light around your entire body. Or with extremely toxic people, visualize a fierce black jaguar patrolling and protecting your energy field to keep out intruders.

6. Define and honor your empathic needs. Safeguard your sensitivities. In a calm, collected moment, make a list of your top five most emotionally rattling situations. Then formulate a plan for handling them so you don’t fumble in the moment. Here are some practical examples of what to do in situations that predictably stymie empaths.
* If someone asks too much of you, politely tell them “no.” It’s not necessary to explain why. As the saying goes, “No is a complete sentence.”
* If your comfort level is three hours max for socializing–even if you adore the people — take your own car or have an alternate transportation plan so you’re not stranded.
* If crowds are overwhelming, eat a high-protein meal beforehand (this grounds you) and sit in the far corner of, say, a theatre or party, not dead center.
* Some empaths are highly sensitive to scents, if you are overwhelmed, for instance by perfume, nicely request that your friends refrain from wearing it around you. If you can’t avoid it, stand near a window or take frequent breaks to catch a breath of fresh air outdoors.

# Clearing Stagnant Energy In A House

Here is a little tip for if you are being plauged by bad or restless dreams/nights...or to be used anywhere in the house where you feel the energy may have become cluttered or stagnant or negative.
but i'll use the bedroom for an example. so doorways and windows are often seen as the entrance way for energies to come into your space. corners are places where energies sometimes clump up or linger. and the bed is where you sleep so if there are thoughts/energies/emotions/etc plaguing you, they are likely to come visiting you in your sleep.
so what you do is you take a broom- some ppl have a broom set aside for things like this, but an ordinary broom is fine. i have a cinnamon broom i use. :) i keep it hanging in my bedroom for extra good vibes. you take your broom and you start at the door to the room and sweep gently all along the entrance and up around the frame of the door and across the top of the frame. then you sweep down the door itself. focusing the whole time on clearing any stuck or negative or just "dusty" energy. then if you feel drawn to any of the corners especially, you go sweep that corner and the walls forming it. or just sweep all corners. closets too. and their doors.
then you gently sweep all around the whole bed. if it's agains a wall, sweep the wall if you can't reach the floor everywhere. finally you lightly sweep over the bed itself. it can be made while you do it, best that it is really. and all the time holding that intention of clearing the space of unwanted energies. if you have deities or animal spirits or any energy beings of any kind whose help you want to ask while you do this, then go ahead. just make sure it is an invitation/request for help, not commanding sounding.
when you are all done brooming, sprinkle a little water mixed w salt or essential oil of preference in all the areas you swept and know that they are all now fresh, clean and protected. :) then the last step is always to thank your broom, any other materials you used, and any good energies that may have helped you out! you can also place small bowls of salt in the corners or a small bowl of salt or salt water under the bed for extra help. :)
just a little energerial "housekeeping" tip for you! it really does help. and if you feel the space is being kind of "taken over" by energies that are negative or "not you" in anyway, it can really help clean that right out and give you back your space to re-fill w energy of your choosing. :sparkles: happy brooming!

# Grounding

i think in other channels here, ppl have talked alot about "grounding"- grounding, along w the ability to connect in general, is one of the most basic magical skills to master (as best one can- it's easiest in formal group circumstances, harder in the middle of ordinary social chaos!)
what ways do ppl use to ground themselves? i'm guessing many have done or maybe currently sometimes do what's often called "tree of life" grounding visualization? where you imagine your roots extending from your feet down through all the layers of the earth, your branches extending up all the way to the sun and above, and then coming back down to sweep around you to touch the earth again, connecting everything up and protecting you from being bombarded from too much energy input at once and/or from incoming negative energy?
that's a pretty common grounding visualization you see many places, including places like therapy in various versions
it can be tweaked in assorted ways- sometimes you go through your branches to see if there are any places that have grown to thick and turned into blocks, requiring pruning...or places where they have worn too thin and need more growing and enrichment...
sometimes ppl mostly focus on the earth/sky connected energies running up and down through their "trunk"
i like to also imagine my roots and branches sweeping out to skim the edges of a river bc i like to be really connected to water too
and i like to imagine myself part of the time sitting crosslegged with my back straight against the tree and a basket in my lap, collecting falling leaves and doing divinations with the lines and veins on them

# Protecting yourself from dark entities

Lightworkers are targets for dark entities. These entities feed off fear.

Reiki, course salt, and sage is effective for clearing negative energy that is left behind in a house. This is not strong enough to clear existing entities like an incubus.

To clear entities, you need to strengthen yourself spiritually. This will take time. Call on Archangel Michael, and use black tourmaline to protect you and create a shield around you. Show no fear, and demand it to leave. The most important thing is to raise your vibrations. When you do this you literally move into another dimension to them, and dark energies cannot connect with you then. Also connect with your spiritual guides and angels; they are here to protect and guide you on your path in this life.

# Personal learnings

## Maria

1. I finally learned and accepted that I CAN'T CHANGE PEOPLE, and I learned to respect their personal journey.
2. But I also learned that what I can control (partially) is to choose those who surround me, and if I don't have control there (let's say, family  colleagues), I can control how often and how much of my time I spend with them and with every person.
3. I try to prioritize my wellbeing and my body needs. And I try to respect the time that my body requires to recharge.
4. I also learned that one WON'T WIN AGAINST A NARCISSIST. arguing or debating is pointless. So, instead, I chose what [the gray stone strategy](https://180rule.com/the-gray-rock-method-of-dealing-with-psychopaths/). I don't give "fuel" to difficult people to fire up. Do I really need to speak up/explain/say my opinion all the time? Not really. My mom used to say "you have to choose your opponents. Some people are not worth the fight".
5. I have learned about my boundaries and try to respect.
6. I tend to fall into over complascency and over generosity. A friend of mine told me many years ago: "you have an beautiful uthopical world in your head. But this society has its own rules. Stick to those for your own sake". She was right. I know now with whom I can be freely giving and open, and with whom I have to stick to the world's rules. I am always kind and helpful, but I won't let anyone take advantage of me anymore.
7. I try to follow my intuition. I try to do, say and be what my hearts tells me to be AS LONG AS I AM GROUNDED. If I am not grounded, I don't do/say anything. Better to wait. The world can wait.
