# Signs of unhealed trauma

1. You’re hurting yourself

self-harm, cutting, drug abuse, overwork

2. You’re hurting others, or lashing out with anger when you least expect it.

“Hurt people hurt people.” aka projection

3. You’re struggling with depression, anxiety, or another serious mental health concern

Depression is anger turned inward. Anxiety is what happens when we cut ourselves off from our feelings and our energy bounces back and forth between our internal walls.

4. You avoid certain places, objects, or people you used to love, because they trigger terrible feelings.

5. You have significant gaps in your memory, particularly surrounding difficult times.

6. You can’t bear to sit alone in silence

Yet the paradoxical truth is that time in silence can actually help us to heal. Once we learn how to act as our own compassionate witness, we can let our pain arise and also let it go.

7. You have certain “shameful” stories you’d never share with anyone.

The way we stop our shame stories from running our lives is not to bury them further, but rather to share them with a kind, present witness who can help us to offer ourselves compassion and forgiveness. That’s how we rise above the toxic mix of shame and addiction.

8. Your inner dialogue is characterized by harsh criticism.

# Strategies for healing

## Talk to someone

Someone that can just be present and be there for you, without judgement and advice. Just being there for you.

## EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)

This a technique that uses acupressure to release blocked energies from our system, which in turn release blocked emotions.

### Points

#### The collar bone point

The junction where the sternum (breastbone), collarbone and the first rib meet. This is a very important point and in acupuncture is referred to as K (kidney) 27. To locate it, first place your forefinger on the U-shaped notch at the top of the breastbone (about where a man would knot his tie). From the bottom of the U, move your forefinger down toward the navel 1 inch and then go to the left (or right) 1 inch. This point is referred to as Collar Bone even though it is not on the collarbone (or clavicle) per se.

the K-27 points interact with all of the nine energy systems and our hands are electromagnetically activated, all energetic systems are literally “jump started” by tapping these points.

K 27 Acupressure Points (on both sides) are good for chest congestion, phlegm, coughing, throat spasms, sore throats, shallow breathing, difficult breathing, chest tightness, chest pain, anxiety, agitation and thyroid gland irregularities.K 27 is the master Yu Point; its also the exit point of the kidney meridian.

## Anxiety

Try colouring in :)
## Time

Time does heal. If you're feeling awful, give it a few days before you do anything drastic about it. It's amazing how much can shift from creating some time and space for yourself. Things do pass.
## Crystals

Place a quartz crystal on the energetic wound, relax and lie down and simply let it do it's work for you.

## Journal

Get it out onto paper whatever is going on for you. [Even Eminem used writing instead of therapy](https://youtu.be/Ji5I03sko8s?t=787); "my best therapy is to get stuff out".

## Reflexology

#  9 Strategies To Stop Absorbing Other People’s Illness and Pain 

1. Evaluate. First, ask yourself: Is this symptom or emotion mine or someone else’s? It could be both. If the emotion such as fear or anger is yours, gently confront what’s causing it on your own or with professional help. If it’s not yours, try to pinpoint the obvious generator.
2. Move away. When possible, distance yourself by at least twenty feet from the suspected source. See if you feel relief. Don’t err on the side of not wanting to offend strangers. In a public place, don’t hesitate to change seats if you feel a sense of “dis-ease” imposing on you.
3. Know your vulnerable points. Each of us has a body part that is more vulnerable to absorbing others’ stress. Mine is my gut. Scan your body to determine yours. Is it you neck? Do you get sore throats? Headaches? Bladder infections? At the onset of symptoms in these areas, place your palm there and keep sending loving-kindness to that area to soothe discomfort. For longstanding depression or pain, use this method daily to strengthen yourself. It’s comforting and builds a sense of safety and optimism.
4. Surrender to your breath. If you suspect you are picking up someone else’s symptoms, concentrate on your breath for a few minutes. This is centering and connects you to your power.
5. Practice Guerilla Meditation. To counter emotional or physical distress, act fast and meditate for a few minutes. Do this at home, at work, at parties, or conferences. Or, take refuge in the bathroom. If it’s public, close the stall. Meditate there. Calm yourself. Focus on positivity and love.
6. Set healthy limits and boundaries. Control how much time you spend listening to stressful people, and learn to say “no.” Remember, “no” is a complete sentence.
7. Visualize protection around you. Visualize an envelope of white light around your entire body. Or with extremely toxic people, visualize a fierce black jaguar patrolling and protecting your energy field against intruders.
8. Develop X ray vision. The spaces between the vertebrae in your lower back (lumbar spine) are conducive to eliminating pain from the body. It’s helpful to learn to mindfully direct pain out of these spaces by visualizing it leaving your body. Say goodbye to pain as it blends with the giant energy matrix of life!
9. Take a bath or shower. A quick way to dissolve stress is to immerse yourself in water. My bath is my sanctuary after a busy day. It washes away everything from bus exhaust to long hours of air travel to pesky symptoms I have taken on from others. Soaking in natural mineral springs divinely purifies all that ails.

# Saunas: 9 Reasons Why Are Great Health Support for Empaths
1. Saunas Improve Mood and Reduce Depression
Saunas are somewhat stressful on the body, so your brain produces and releases more euphoric hormones to deal with it.
2. Saunas Reduce Anxiety and Stress
Several studies have shown that regular sauna use lowers levels of cortisol, your body’s main stress hormone (49-52). 
3. Saunas Increase Beta-Endorphins, Relieve Pain and Help Treat Fibromyalgia
Your brain produces and releases these natural painkillers during times of strenuous exercise, emotional stress and pain. Since saunas are a stressor, the release of endorphins are increased when you spend time in one.
4. Saunas Increase Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)
Research shows that heat exposure increases the expression of BDNF. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a naturally-occurring protein in the brain that lowers your risk of mental disease and improves your mood. It does this by protecting and repairing your brain cells and increasing the growth of new brain cells. Many researchers consider it a natural antidepressant because it can reduce anxiety and depression.
5. Saunas Increase Norepinephrine Levels and May Help Treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Numerous studies have found that sauna use significantly increases norepinepherine levels. Norepinephrine, also called noradrenaline, is a hormone and neurotransmitter in the brain that can help with focus and attention.
6. Saunas Encourage the Growth of Myelin
Heat stress increases prolactin, a hormone that promotes the production of myelin.  Myelin is a fatty, white substance that wraps around the end of many nerve cells. It forms an electrically insulating sheath that increases nerve condition speeds. In other words, it allows your brain to send information faster and more efficiently, making it absolutely essential for the optimal functioning of your nervous system.
7. Saunas Reduce Symptoms of Chronic Fatigue
One study found that infrared sauna sessions significantly reduce fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. It also significantly reduced their anxiety and depression
8. Saunas Reduce Tension Headaches
9. Saunas Increase Deep Sleep.

# Interventions to Halt Energetic Eating

When the impulse to overeat hits:

1. Discern addictive craving from a true need.
Addictive craving, a symptom of nutritional abuse, is a frequent response to energetic overload. Here, you eat certain foods addictively; this leads to obesity. Whenever you keep lusting after sweets and carbs, be suspicious. With cravings, you eat to relieve stress, not to build energy. Try to identify addictive foods and limit them.
With a true nutritional need there’s no lusting after food to guard against stress. A true need comes from a centered place, not from self-medicating emotions with comfort foods or obsession. Feeling healthily nurtured from food never involves mood swings — sedation or elation — but rather an even feeling of satisfaction. A true need lets you enjoy your meal, optimizes energy and doesn’t lead to obesity.

2. Quickly pinpoint energetic triggers of addictive cravings.
Immediately ask yourself: “Was I exposed to stress?” It could have been an obnoxious neighbor or phone messages from your mother. Don’t write off the “smaller” incidents, which notoriously send empaths motoring to the refrigerator. Don’t panic. Pinpoint cause and effect. Clear it quickly once you’ve been slimed.

3. Breathe stress out of your system.
Take a five-minute break for damage control. Slowly inhale and exhale. Breath activates your calming endorphins (natural painkillers) and releases stress from the body. Practice this visualization: Just as your lungs take in oxygen and expel toxic carbon dioxide, breathe in peacefulness and clarity, breathe out stress. Breathe in vitality. Breathe out fear. Repeat this exercise until you feel calmer.

4. Try a three-minute meditation.
Another way to calm yourself before you run to the refrigerator is with a three-minute meditation. I recommend keeping a meditation cushion in front of the refrigerator to remind yourself to meditate before opening the door.

5. Set healthy limits and boundaries.
With stressful people, limit the time you spend listening to them, and learn how to say “no.” Remember, “no” is a complete sentence.

6. Take a bath or shower.
A speedy way to dissolve stress is to immerse yourself in water. 

7.Eat with attunement.
Develop a diet that satisfies your energetic needs. Whatever you put in you mouth that is healthy, run it by your energy meter; see what truly nourishes or depletes. For instance, does chicken give you more energy than fish? Tomatoes more than carrots? Even foods you’ve shunned become more attractive when your experience their energy lift.

8. Visualize a protective barrier around yourself.

### How Toxic Personalities In Your Family Tree Can Affect Your Future Relationships

>"Traumas do not sleep, even with death, but rather continue to look for the fertile ground of resolution in the children of the following generations," says neuroscientist Norman Diodge, M.D

>We remember stories, not facts, because the hormones oxytocin and cortisol are released when we hear stories. This has implications for healing from trauma, because when we understand the root of the trauma, we have a coherent story behind the toxic relationships we keep finding ourselves in. This allows us to have empathy for ourselves and gives our brains a sense of closure. We stop blaming ourselves for being attracted to these personality types and stop seeing ourselves as stupid or naive. Those thoughts are dangerous: Self-blame can fuel anxiety and hopelessness. Only closure and forgiveness can help us stop repeating negative patterns.
