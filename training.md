### Lesson 1

Know all that is knowable, then proceed. Remain where you are until you know.

We are all in a classroom which is our planet Earth.
Our books are nature, the elements, the visual panorama of life, and living together.

Tools:
1. Make sure all your communication is truthful and intentional.
2. Listen to understand.
3. Practice till you master your lesson.
4. Self intention.

### Lesson 2

Our soul is part of a Universal whole. We are actually all connected and not separate as we are encouraged to feel.

If someone feels toxic to you, send them healing energy, and move on. It's not up to us if they awaken or not.

What's really important is how people feel, not what they say or do.
