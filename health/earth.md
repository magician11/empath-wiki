### Atmospheric radiation levels are extreme

Strontium 90 is being sprayed into our atmosphere. It has a half life of 28 years. No living being should be breathing this.

The best defence against this is to drink a baking soda and iodine cocktail twice a week. Seaweed, especially kelp is great too.
