## Lessons

### Lesson 1

Know all that is knowable, then proceed. Remain where you are until you know.

We are all in a classroom which is our planet Earth.
Our books are nature, the elements, the visual panorama of life, and living together.

Tools:
1. Make sure all your communication is truthful and intentional.
2. Listen to understand.
3. Practice till you master your lesson.
4. Self intention.

> When you first start learning to communicate.
> The rules of speach and writing are learned.
>
> Vocabulary is important. When reading you gain a working understanding of what is written when using the vocabulary In your minds eye. You become used to the vernacular. You are imprinted by the knowledge being presented.
>
>The practice of vernacular in a subject is vital. As info may seem dry or boring.
>It is imperative to keep reading. The moment an idea turns nothing into recognition is worth the effort
>
>The habit of ingesting data is important
>
>If you want the bubble gum. You must unwrap then chew 

i.e. Don't just learn a few things, use it and put it into practice.

### Lesson 2

Our soul is part of a Universal whole. We are actually all connected and not separate as we are encouraged to feel.

If someone feels toxic to you, send them healing energy, and move on. It's not up to us if they awaken or not.

![let go toxic people](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/582975748894228498/584765118387060797/WhatsApp_Image_2019-06-02_at_15.21.27.jpeg?width=242&height=301)

What's really important is how people feel, not what they say or do.

### Lesson 3

It is imperative for you to open your mind totally. Your awareness is active and has the ability to sense everything all the time. It is actually doing this right now.

Opening up to that moment is all. When it is reached there is no doubt your there. 

Your sense of perception is key.

Meditation with intent. Focus.
See what is really there. 
Expirement with purpose to KNOW THE TRUTH

Intent is the key.

Its work is desirable.

The reward or lesson learned. Valuable

Why. Because you OWN IT.

it becomes YOU.

## Important People

### Pythagoras

- Born 570 BC on Greek Isle of Samos
- Moved to Egypt in 535 BCE for 20 years where he learnt mathematics, Egyptian culture, religion.
- He setup a school in Samos, but left because he refused to get involved in politics. He then setup a school Italy.

The main belief in Pythagoreanism is that everything can be reduced to numbers and be explained by mathematics.

Music
- He contributed to music theory: intervals between harmonious musical notes always have whole number ratios. So as you divide a string and pluck it, you will go up an octave.
Mathematics
- He contributed to mathematics: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and the discovery of irrational numbers
- tetraktys: 10 was sacred to him
![tetraktys](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewtopiamagazine.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Ftetraktys-pitagorica.jpg&f=1)
- the pentagram has a lot of cool mathematical properties, including the golden ratio

![pentagram](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-nYx7ieJd9LE%2FVgnc3Njrv1I%2FAAAAAAAAAwA%2FHGPVjswQSRg%2Fs1600%2Fpythagorean-pentagram.jpg&f=1)

Spirituality
- Spiritual contribution: reincarnation (all animals are part of the same family)
- Way of life: religious rituals, dietary restrictions, vows of silence

End of life
- He died in 490 BCE at age 75.

### Lesson 4

How To Tell If Someone Is Truly Smart Or Just Average (on [Medium](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2))

> One of the most effective and universal mental models is the 80/20 Rule: the idea that 20 percent of inputs can lead to 80 percent of outputs.

> To apply the 80/20 Rule, at the beginning of the day we can ask ourselves, “Of all the things on my to-do list, what are the 20 percent that will create 80 percent of the results?” When we’re searching for what to read next, we can ask ourselves, “Of all the millions of books I could buy, which ones could really change my life?” When considering who to spend time with, we can ask ourselves, “Which handful of people in my life give me the most happiness, the most meaning, and the greatest connection?” In short, consistently using the 80/20 Rule can help us get leverage by focusing on the few things that really matter and ignoring the majority that don’t.

> people who are able to model how this more complex reality works will be far more successful at navigating it. Or, as Ray Dalio says in his book, “Truth — or, more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality — is the essential foundation for any good outcome.”

Nice way to explain machine learning...

> The numerous dog models on the right (the contrasting cases example) show us that dogs can come in all different colors, sizes, and shapes. At the same time, we can see the underlying element of “dogness” that they all share. This emergent element of “dogness” is a deeper mental model, and humans created the word “dog” to symbolize this mental model. Using that mental model, you can identify an animal as a dog even if you’ve never seen a particular breed of dog before.

[Smart People Really Do Think Faster](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102169531&t=1560101955853): The smarter the person (based on IQ tests), the faster nerve impulses travel in their brain.

### Lesson 5

[Fukushima Radiation Has Contaminated The Entire Pacific Ocean](http://wtsenates.info/Portals/0/Documents/What_Happen_to_the_Reindeer_in_Norway_3-OCT-2016.pdf). It's been far more devastating than we were told. News about it is largely suppressed. There is a significant amount of radiation in the air, and it's circulating around the planet. Governments are secretly doing what they can to neutralise the radiation with chem trails. The dramatic increase in cancers in the world is directly related to this incident. [The nuclear disaster has contaminated the world's largest ocean in only five years and it's still leaking 300 tons of radioactive waste every day.](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-02/fukushima-radiation-has-contaminated-entire-pacific-ocean-and-its-going-get-worse)

### Lesson 6

#### Astral projection
- [How to Astral Project | Beginner's Guide | Powerful Technique (TUTORIAL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjactF34biM)
  - hypnagogic state is a great spring board to do an OBE. Like deep hypnosis.
  - sleep paralysis is normal
  - vibrational stage: energy vibrations that can be strong or mild, buzzing sounds
  - separation stage: lots of variety; drop down, ascend
  - the key to staying out is to relax. Not to think of the body. We have a silver chord attached to our physical body. So no need to worry about not coming back.
  - the target technique: get relaxed, esp hypnagogic state. Pick a person or thing far away from you, esp if it has special meaning to me. Remember all the sensations of being around the target... maintaining conscious focus on the target.
  
[Randy Veitenheimer](https://energydoktor.com/) was interviewed and [speaks about his esoteric approach to remote viewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSZeozFvm0)
- People who are an intellectual, have restraints from exploring their internal landscape.
- It's more about the province of the practitioner not the technique.
- The esoteric method is valid. Your consciousness is everywhere in the Universe.
- The scientific method is limited or incapable in translating certain things like love. Knowingness is a higher form of intellect. Science doesn't like anecdotal or experiential. So you cannot validate, for example, dream states. So much of human existence is beyond scientific validation. Science is insufficient, because it creates doubt.
- Neutrality is the primary tool to be able to remote view.
- Machines are best used when our consciousness is extended into it.
- People who have more life experience have more languaging in how to describe a remote view.
- It's absolutely more important to be truthful than right.
  
#### Truth 

> Inginuity is the most interesting way to learn. Take what you've listened to and build your own.

> Truth makes you happy

> Truth
> Sets you free
> For real

![Joy = happiness](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582975748894228498/588842913165737997/walterscott1-2x.jpg)

Society has taught horror as a norm. To make us hate. To keep us separate and against one another. We act in tantrum. Or hate. Or averous desire to control.

So as for ETs, we at this point would not respect them. Or welcome them in peace. We are already planning to fight them. To keep our way of life. To prevent their imagined control over us.

> This is why truth. Honesty is imperative. Opening our heart and mind knowing that it is only way to grow.
> This is NOT A COMFORTABLE thing to do.
> It is hard. It is real. It changes everything.
> You become free.

### Lesson 7

- [Masaru Emoto Water Experiment - Water Consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOp-bxNug5A)
  - What are the two most important words? Love and Gratitude

### Lesson 8

- [What You Need To Know About The AKASHIC RECORDS And The MASTERMIND Of Mankind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p9lqnGMK1U)
  - it's more like a biological function
  - data is stored in the neural network of the body.. subatomic particles such as the electron. Not just contained to the body
  - qbit: binary code in supposition.
  - we work the same way to quantum computers
  - human beings are connected
  - we emit radiation in all directions.. which transmit every thing in our cells.. and receive information from others
  - meditation is important
  - dreaming is the optimal way to tune into the Akashic record. Write down your question or issue before sleep.
  - a thought is a physical thing. The human mind is extremely powerful and can control machines.

### Lesson 9

Twin Flames (from [this article](http://www.thelawofattraction.com/twin-flames/))

It feels safe and natural to be your authentic self around this person.

### Lesson 10

The Earth is going through a slow shift: [STRANGE AND UNUSUAL EVENTS IN TURKEY | News June 2019 Part 26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyI09DpMgoI)

[What the Earth looks like after a 40 degree axis shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l0SC3bRLn8)

[Magnetic Excursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvG0hS0BEzc)
  - Magnetic excursion very short lived reversals
  - low field strength enhances UVR
  - excursions are super hard to find
  - UVR stimulates mutations that eventually affect the genome
  - Humans might be ok with the change in UVR, but other species are likely to die out

### Lesson 11

1. Self-actualized people embrace the unknown and the ambiguous.
2. They accept themselves, together with all their flaws.
3. They prioritize and enjoy the journey, not just the destination.
4. While they are inherently unconventional, they do not seek to shock or disturb.
5. They are motivated by growth, not by the satisfaction of needs.
6. Self-actualized people have purpose.
7. They are not troubled by the small things.
8. Self-actualized people are grateful.
9. They share deep relationships with a few, but also feel identification and affection towards the entire human race.
10. Self-actualized people are humble.
11. Self-actualized people resist enculturation.
12. Despite all this, self-actualized people are not perfect.

### Lesson 12

Notes from [this video on Nikola Tesla's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j3wBldVBHo)

Free energy comes from our surroundings. Nikola Tesla could transmit electrical power through the ionosphere without wires or poles. We're swimming in nature. Thus treeing up our time to pursue our creative interests. JP Morgan decided to shut this idea down (it wasn't going to make him money).

[Otis Carr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_T._Carr) put in a patent for a levitation device, and they would only award him a patent if they removed the levitation part.. so it was an amusement park patent.

The flying saucer was powered by magnets in nature; 12 double tetrahedrons (utrons), 12 horse shoe magnets. Counter-rotating wheels. As the utrons went through the magnetic field it would generate vibrational power. When it gets to the resonant frequency of your surroundings, it goes to a zero point. From there you can go anywhere you want.

The craft is operated by your mind. Synergetic connection; the craft has a consciousness of its own. They levitate and teleport. They traverse through multidimensions. Giant crystal ball in a gyroscopic holder with lazers pointing up into it. Focusing thoughts drive it. To be able to operate this, you need to raise your consciousness.

When you're in the mind space, above the brain space. You get a sense of knowing, and that you are an infinite being. UFOs are toys to point to this realisation.

This was shut down because the international banking system was threatened by this research.

Addendum: Travelling in time in your physical body is not possible. But you can astral project. If you build a machine that is conscious, then it can come back. When the crystal ball is powered up, it's interdimensionally in flux. The whole system is electromagnetic, so ET's UFO's need a boost from lightning to boost out. If you can go into the past you can go into the future. Space is dangerous. Even UFOs breakdown. ETs likely peek into the future to avert tragedies.

[Notes on how copper interacts with magnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sENgdSF8ppA). Summary: Lenz's Law And Faraday's Law of Induction to generate electricity and magnetic force fields in copper.

Copper is not magnetic. Dropping a magnet on a copper plate will land softly. When a magnetic field moves through copper, it causes electrons to reorganise in a circular pattern perpendicular to the oncoming magnetic field. They generate a temp magnetic field of their own. The magnets momentum is converted into electrical current.

### Lesson 13

[Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi Internet | Harald Haas](https://youtu.be/iHWIZsIBj3Q)

- There is a  rich infrastructure of LEDs
- solar cells in solar panels absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy
- if incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell
- 50Mb/s data transfer possible so definitely fast enough for video streaming
- in essence: the solar cell has become a receiver for high speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains it's primary function as an energy harvesting device
