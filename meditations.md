# The meditation using the four elements(Air,Water,Earth,Fire)

## Air

The easiest one or for started is the air element. You just sit down crossed legged and let the rays of the sun go down your body. As it warms your skin try visualizing the air around you slowly moving around your body, forming a sort of bubble with a little black hole at the top of your head. The negative energy getting absorbed by the black hole and little by little you get whiter/brighter shining more and more. The air filling the space becoming a spongy bubble. The key is that you feel the air around you and try not to focus too hard or force yourselves.

## Water

The water one is quite easy too once you have the visualization down. sit down crossed leg, facing the sun is optional. With a bowl or water in front of you imagine the water's energy flowing down from your head and slowly washing away all the negative emotions down till your feet and back into the bowl. It helps if you kind of have your hands a little wet and your forehead too, helps with the imagination. After the meditation be sure not to drink the water or pour it into the plants ^-^. if possible pour it directly on the soil or in the sink.

## Earth

The earth one is third as it requires you to visualize the mother earth cleansing your body and soul as well. Sit down crossed leg on the grass outside under a tree. Try to feel the air around your skin, feel the energy. After that visualize the core of the planet, the molten lava, the energy reaching the surface of the planet flowing into your bodies from your feet and up slowly pushing out all those negative energies.(The earth is considered neutral hence it empties the body of the negative energies easier) after completed replenish the positive energies from the air or water ^-^. It helps it you do this in the morning as the air is more clean and the birds singing relaxes the body easier.

## Fire

The one with fire is a little tricky and harder to master but is the most effective for protection. Light a candle(be careful not to burn yourselves and you can place it in a bowl with a little water just to be safe) sit down crossed leg or on a chair. Start by visualizing the energy of the flame, warm, hot and comfy too. Making a link from your third eye, visualizing the flame on your third eye burning slowly attracting all the negative energies and burning them away while making an energy barrier all over your body(you might start sweating and your whole body will feel warmed up that's usual). Feel the flame, that is the tip i can give you ^-^ it protects you from the evil energies and heightens your intuition. You might have futuristic dreams like i do, so do not be afraid if you have any of those
i did my best to explain it as simple as possible,if you have any questions or if there is anything that is hard to get do tell me. Ill be glad to help you all.
