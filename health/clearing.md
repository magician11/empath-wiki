# Clearing your own energy

## The elements

> saltwater baths for the feet are good for cleansing energy and grounding (or saltwater baths in general). a follow-up w rose oil of some sort is also good, so i've been doing rose oil in my hair when i wash. the "chop, brush, fluff" method of aura cleansing- which i definitely have to do more of and should really do over running water as well so the water can carry the energy away. a pool (a couple) and a sauna and whirlpool too- i think the more water, the better.

> wind is also very good for me. the very best thing is to go to the beach- regardless of weather- and stick your feet in the salt water there. walk along the edge, feel the sand and water and wind, hope for a glimpse of sun...maybe i'll get up early on sun w my friend who's going to be visiting for the weekend and we can get to the beach before any one else does, when there's plenty of parking, few dogs and lots of good ocean and birds!

# Clearing a space/room

You can clear things via intuition:

- What do you feel, automatically without overthinking it too much, would make the space feel cleared and refreshed?
- What actions or words would help you bring tha clarity and freshness to the space, just from the top of your imagination?

### Smudging



> things like smudging and other such practices are hard bc you have to have at least a minimal sense of what you need to do beyond simply lighting the smudge stick and waving it around...it's the focus/energy and imagination work you do "behind" the smudging that is the true work of the cleansing...the smudge stick may have its own beneficial properties in awakening senses, clearing unwanted things but it can't do it on its own, if that makes sense. the person doing the smudging needs to be pretty deeply focused on the ritual at hand as well for the best results.

On clearing the sage smell

> putting some bowls of lemon water w a little vinegar and/or cloves here and there might soak up the remaining sage smell
