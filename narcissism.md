It's an unfortunate and common pairing for empaths to get involved in some capacity with narcissists.

## The Science Behind Psychopaths and Extreme Altruists

Some things that stood out..

> We are the most social species on Earth, and we are also the most violent species on Earth,” says Jean Decety, a social neurologist at the University of Chicago. “We have two faces because these two faces were important to survival.
> But in recent decades researchers have made significant advances toward understanding the science of what drives good and evil. Both seem to be linked to a key emotional trait: empathy, which is an intrinsic ability of the brain to experience how another person is feeling.

> Temporary states such as drunkenness, fear, or hunger can briefly reduce our empathy responses, while childhood trauma can have longer term effects.
> A widespread empathy shutdown can occur when an entire group of people conforms to an ideology of aggression or superiority, such as during wartime.

> [psychopaths] recognize how and when to feign empathy

>Psychopaths have utter disregard for the feelings of others, although they seem to learn to mimic emotions. “They really just have a complete inability to appreciate anything like empathy or guilt or remorse,” says Kent Kiehl, a neuroscientist at the Mind Research Network and the University of New Mexico who was drawn to studying psychopathy in part because he grew up in a neighborhood that was once home to the serial killer Ted Bundy. These are people who are “just extremely different than the rest of us.

>The psychopath appears to compensate for this deficiency by using other parts of the brain to cognitively simulate what really belongs in the realm of emotion. “That is, the psychopath must think about right and wrong while the rest of us feel it,” Kiehl wrote in a paper he co-authored in 2011.

>When looking at fearful faces, donors showed a greater response in their right amygdala than a control group. Separately, the researchers found that their right amygdalas were, on average, 8 percent larger than those of the control group. Similar studies done previously on psychopathic subjects had found the opposite: The amygdalas in psychopathic brains are smaller and activated less than those in controls while reacting to frightened faces.

>Gregory Stanton, a former U.S. State Department official and founder of Genocide Watch, a nonprofit that works to prevent mass murder, has identified the stages that can cause otherwise decent people to commit murder. It starts when demagogic leaders define a target group as “the other” and claim it is a threat to the interests of supporters. Discrimination follows, and soon the leaders characterize their targets as subhuman, eroding the in-group’s empathy for “the other.”
>
>Next, society becomes polarized. “Those planning the genocide say, ‘You are either with us or against us,’ ” says Stanton. This is followed by a phase of preparation, with the architects of the genocide drawing up death lists, stocking weapons, and planning how the rank and file are to execute the killings. Members of the out-group are sometimes forced to move into ghettos or concentration camps. Then the massacres begin.
>
>Many of the perpetrators remain untouched by remorse, not because they are incapable of feeling it—as is the case with psychopathic killers—but because they find ways to rationalize the killings.

## THE PSYCHOPATH - The Mask of Sanity

> 4 percent of the people on this planet have no conscience.  The presence or absence of conscience is a deep human division, arguably more significant than intelligence, race, or even gender.  What distinguishes these people from the rest of us is an utterly empty hole in the psyche, where there should be the most evolved of all humanizing functions.

On whether psychopaths are born that way, or is it a result of trauma in their upbringing?

> Some researchers think that psychopathy is the result of some attachment or bonding difficulty as an infant. Dr. Hare has turned the idea around, after all his years digging into the background of psychopaths. He says: In some children the very failure to bond is a symptom of psychopathy. It is likely that these children lack the capacity to bond readily, and that their lack of attachment is largely the result, not the cause, of psychopathy. In other words: they are born that way and you can't fix them.

## Techniques to Handle Narcissists (N_s)
Article Based on the Book "How to Handle a Narcissist: Understanding and Dealing with a Range of Narcissistic Personalities" by Theresa Jackson

1. Get away from them. 
Either drastically, by taking breaks or managing the situation. Trying to open their eyes to the cause of tehir problems, help or change them, is more likely to misfire with defensiveness or lead to resentment. Ask: "should this deal be made at all?". With narcissists, you are unlikely to get a fair deal. It is important to choose right the people you spend time with wisely, because humans tend to adopt the characteristics of those around them (Ripple effect).

2. Avoid the innter circle. 
If you need to keep N_s in your life, is safer to do at distance due to their chaotic changes in temperament. Creating distance but remaining warm allows you to welcome part of their life without suffering so many falls from grace. Remember that many people (specially those under control) may not be able to see the situation clearly. Those who question the "status quo" that the harmful N_s finds most threatening are the one who suffer most acutely at their hands. 

3. Avoid narcissistic injury. 
For N_s, any perceived threat or challenge is likely to be aggressively countered and they become hypervigilant of people they see as threatening. It can be beneficial to lie low and purposely reduce the traits of your own that may make them feel competitive or badly about themselves.

4. Avoid exposing them. 
Forget about being right and bringing the truth to light. N_s can be extremely vindictive, even using others in their counterattack. 

5. Admire and listen to them. 
Being amenable is probably the most passive technique you can take, but so long as you are not already on the N_s's "naughty list" can be really effective at pulling you through difficult times until you reach calmer waters. Remaining quiet and allowing the N_s to come up with reasosns to congratulate themselves is easy, efortless and requires nothing more than listening and looking interested without getting too close or intimate.

6. Don't reject them. 
Rejection cause a deep narcissistic injury and an unexpectedly intense response. It's best to give them a legitimate reason that is beyong your control than to show you're chosing to reject them. 

7. Avoid showing weaknesses or needs, and give them an "out" when they attack. 
If you show N_s what it is that makes you vulnerable, they may at some point use it agianst you when they want to manipulate you. They will learn what it is that you want most from them and cut it off so you are in constant state of "need". They will needle you on your points of weakness, to make themselves feel strong again. Take a diplomatic "I know I'll be happy either way" approach. Their power to bring you down whilst raising themselves higher is lost. Eventually N_s will learn that you are not "easily pinned". Also, you can push them out of playing manipulative games by offering an "out". For example by saying: "you're being uncharasteristically pessimistic today - you're usually such an optimist- is there anything wrong?". If the attack is particularly vicius or nasty, avoid emotions and maintain a cool, calm and empathic approach works well to bring them back around. Providing them with an excuse that effectively excuses their behavior will be much appreciated as it helps to avoid a crushing sense of shame and subsequent denial loops, and simply feel they are understood and forgiven.

8. Don't expect fairness.
Extreme N_s are likely to be far more concerned wit getting what they want than ensuring that everyone is treated fairly. Rewards their behavior rather than their words so that they only get what they want, when you get what you want too. Extending credit or accepting promises from extreme N_s is a dangerous leap of faith and may not be rewarded. Make sure you get what they promise before you give them what they want. 

9. Know that they want to look good. Giving extreme N_s a way to be impressive if they do as they are told makes them easier to deal with, so long as you ensure you get what you are wanting upfront.

10. Understand what type of narcissistic supply they are addicted to. 
What exactly do they want from you? They often prioritize relationships and career choices based on how much praise or attention they can receive. If they have chosen you as part of their life, it may be that you provide a high level of narcissistic supply. Enthusiasm, love, caring and kindness are often qualities they look for in others. The amount and availability of "supply" takes precedence over other qualities like family responsibility, shared interests or mutual concern for each other. If you have not been chosen voluntarily, your replationsip quality depends on how readily give narcissistic supply, or whether you question or criticize them. N_s are essentially addicted to their supply. It shouldn't be your intent to "love bomb" or swamp N_s with supply, as in doing so you are effectively harming them. Taking responsibility for not damaging their wellbeing- whilst protecting your own- is as important for them as it is for anyone else. 
* An audience. Ns spend a great deal of time talking about themselves, specially about how much they have accomplished in life. This feeds their need to feel special. 
* Status. Ns want to associate with high status people or other high-status Ns to feel superior to others, but alternatively, they want company from someone who is "lower" than they are to compare themselves to, for a similar sense of superiority. 
* Sex. It may be that Ns engage in sexual relationships for sex and sex alone. They may revel in their ability to seduce, in their sexual performance, or in a sense of higher status or dominance.
* Love. Ns people like to feel that there is someone who loves them and wants to be with them. This can result in higher levels of infidelity or cheating, but if Ns define themselves as "moral" then cheating itself could result in chrushing shame and self-loathing, making it less likely to happen.

11. Keeping N_s in Line without flooding them with supply. 
Asking them to consider their reputation can make them think more carefully than asking them to consider other people's feelings. Try asking them what people would think of what they did or asking probing questions to trigger them into having an alternative idea themselves. Focusing on disappointment and emphasizing community rather than negotiating on points or becoming angry can help to change their choices. Help them to look good through doing good. Encouraging empathy by looking at why others could be disappointed or why N_s won't look good or why certain behaviors would help them look good, may help them develop a more considerate approach.

# Traits

- Narcissists are excellent at hiding that they are a narcissist. They can, for instance, create so much drama around them, that untargeted people mistakenly assume the "bad" person is someone else.
